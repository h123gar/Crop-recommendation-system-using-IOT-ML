# Crop_Recommendation
This project uses IoT sensors to collect real-time environmental data such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. A machine learning model processes this data to recommend the most suitable crops for a given area. Built with Django, the system provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to access crop suggestions based on current conditions, promoting efficient and sustainable farming.
